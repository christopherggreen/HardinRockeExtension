\title{MCD Covariance Estimate}
\description{
  This is a slight modification of the \code{CovMcd} function
  from the \code{rrcov} package for use with Cerioli et al. (2009)
  replication and extension work presented in Green and Martin (2014). 
  The modifications provide more flexibility in computing the 
  reweighted MCD estimate.

  \item{reweighting}{A list describing how to perform the reweighting

    \describe{
      \item{method: }{Method to score observations in the reweighting.
        Must be a string from the set (\code{"chisquare","empirical"}). 
        \code{"chisquare"} uses a quantile from a chi-squared distribution,
        while \code{"empirical"} will use a quantile from the empirical
        distribution of the Mahalanobis distances calculated from the 
        unreweighted MCD estimate. Default is \code{"chisquare"}.}
      \item{quantile: }{The quantile to use in scoring. Default is 0.975
        for the chi-squared distribution, which matches how the 
      unmodified \code{covMcd} works.}
      \item{debug: }{TRUE to print additional debugging information; currently 
        prints the Mahalanobis distances (sorted) calculated from the 
        unreweighted MCD estimate. Defaults to FALSE.}

\details{
  This function is a modification of \code{CovMcd} from the \code{rrcov}
  package and uses a modified version of \code{covMcd} from the 
  \code{robustbase} package. It works identically to those functions but 
  allows for more flexibility in the reweighting portion of the calculation.
  This was needed to run/extend some of the experiments in Cerioli et al. (2009),
  particularly those presented in Table 3 of that paper, where the reweighting
  threshold is a Bonferroni-corrected quantile.

  The main work is done inside \code{covMcd2}, a private function to the
  \code{HardinRockeExtension} package. This function is a modified version of
  \code{covMcd} from the \code{robustbase} package: it replaces the
  quantity \code{quantiel} used in the reweighting with a function of the same
  name that computes the quantile specified in the \code{reweighting}
  argument.
}
\value{
  An S4 object of class \code{\link{CovMcd-class}} which is a subclass of the
  virtual class \code{\link{CovRobust-class}}. See \code{\link[rrcov]{CovMcd}}
  for more details.

\note{
  This function is subject to change as the \code{CovMcd} and \code{covMcd}
  functions change. It may also be out of sync with those functions at 
  times.

  The latest version of \code{covMcd} (from \code{robustbase} version 0.92-5)
  has support for a custom weighting function, so at some point in the future
  the need to use a modified version of \code{covMcd} might be eliminated.
