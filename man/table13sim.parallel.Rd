\description{
  Replicates the experiment presented in Cerioli et al. (2009), 
  Tables 1 and 3, for a wider variety of estimators.
}
\usage{
table13sim.parallel(cl, p, nn, N, B = 250, alpha = c(0.01, 0.025, 0.05), lgf = "", mlgf = "", maxtries = 100)
}
\arguments{
  \item{cl}{A cluster object, e.g., returned from \code{makePSOCKcluster}.
    The user must create this object before calling \code{table13sim.parallel}.}
  \item{p}{The dimension of the data used in each simulated run.}
  \item{nn}{The number of observations used in each simulated run.}
  \item{N}{The number of simulations to run.}
  \item{B}{The batch/block size: the number of simulations to run 
    in each block. This is useful when running very large
    simulation runs (\code{N} very large) where memory is a concern. 
	Blocks are distributed across cluster nodes, so this is also a means
	of controlling the workload on each node.}
  \item{alpha}{The significance level to use for detecting outliers. Can
    be a vector; the outlier detection tests will be run at each level.}
  %\item{cutoff.method}{String indicating with asymptotic distribution to use
  %  for the MCD-based distances. Valid values are \code{"HR05"} for the
  %  method of Hardin and Rocke (2005), and \code{"GM14"} for the method
  %  of Green and Martin (2014). Default is \code{"GM14"}.}
  \item{lgf}{Path to log file into which logging information should be
    written.}
  \item{mlgf}{ not used at this time }
  \item{maxtries}{The maximum number of times to retry failed blocks. The Rocke
    S-estimator can fail when \eqn{n/p} is small if it gets a bad random sample, 
	so we restart such blocks. Default is 100.}
}
\details{
  This is a work function designed for use in replicating Tables 1 and 3
  of Cerioli et al. (2009), pages 344--346, but using the asymptotic method
  of Green and Martin (2014) instead of the Hardin-Rocke method. The
  experiment investigates how many false-positives certain Mahalanobis-based
  tests of outlyingness produce, compared to the nominal Type I error
  rate \eqn{\alpha}.

  For the simulataneous outlier tests, some of the reweighted MCD estimates use
  a Bonferroni-corrected quantile to compute the inclusion/exclusion threshold.
  This significance level used is \eqn{\alpha/nn}, and the quantile used is the
  \eqn{ ( 1 - \alpha/nn ) } quantile of the reference distribution (e.g., chi-squared).
  This calculation currently requires the use of the function \code{\link{covMcd2}}. 

  Green and Martin also considered some simultaneous outlier tests using quantiles
  computed based on the distribution of a maximum of iid randon variables. The significance
  level is \eqn{1 - ((1-\alpha)^(1/nn))} and the quantile used is the 
  \eqn{ ( 1 - \alpha )^(1/nn) } quantile of the reference distribution. These tests
  are indicated by the suffix ``ALT'' in the return value of \code{table13sim.parallel}.

  Internally the simulation function does \code{B} runs at a time. Blocks
  of size \code{B} are distributed across the cluster. Set \code{B} smaller if 
  your machines have less memory or you have lots of cluster nodes.
}
\value{An array of dimension 3:
  \enumerate{
    \item{The results of each of the \code{N} simulation runs appear along the first dimension.}
	\item{The various estimators and tests appear along the second dimension. Results with
	  suffix ``T1'' correspond to Table 1 of Cerioli et al. (2009) (the individual outlier tests)
	  while those with suffix ``T3'' correspond to Table 3 (the simultaneous outlier tests).
